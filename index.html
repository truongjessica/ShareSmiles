          <p>While stuck in my house, I decided to do something productive.</p>
          <p>
            Though I had no prior sewing skill, I had plenty of time to learn. I
            watched videos on how to create masks that would help healthcare
            workers during this hard time.

            I haven't read in a long time due to the busy hustle of my daily
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently picked up a book that has been sitting on my shelf for so
            long and read. And read. And read. I finished the book in a day! It
            was such a great book and I'm glad I got back into reading.
